Plotting interactive maps is easy with the leaflet package in R. In this short guide we’ll use the Launceston Public Seating dataset to plot markers, add pop-ups and freeze the map on an area of interest. Let’s get started.
Load the leaflet and dplyr libraries:
library(leaflet) library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39; ## The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:stats&amp;#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:base&amp;#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union Now lets look at our dataset." />

<p>Interactive Maps in R with leaflet 2018-07-24</p>
<p>Plotting interactive maps is easy with the leaflet package in R. In this short guide we’ll use the Launceston Public Seating dataset to plot markers, add pop-ups and freeze the map on an area of interest. Let’s get started.</p>
<p>Load the leaflet and dplyr libraries:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;:

<pre><code>## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;:
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union</code></pre>
<p>Now lets look at our dataset.</p>
<div id="launceston-seats" class="section level2">
<h2>Launceston Seats</h2>
<p>On the 20th of July, 2018, the City of Launceston, Tasmania released the ‘Public Seating’ dataset containing 1011 public seats complete with geo-coordinates, materials (aluminium, timber, etc.) and type (seat with back, seat without back, bench, etc.)</p>
<p>The dataset can be found here <a href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/public-seating-1c0ab" class="uri">https://data.gov.au/dataset/public-seating-1c0ab</a></p>
<p>Import the data into your R environment:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>seats_data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Public_Seating.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Call str() on the dataset and take a look and what we’ve got (i’m ommitting the 13th variable in the dataset because it’s an obscurely layered list of metadata - it won’t be useful for our purposes):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str(seats_data[,1:12])</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &#39;data.frame&#39;:    1011 obs. of  12 variables:

<p>Just as an aside, you could also do it this way…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str(seats_data[,-13])</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &#39;data.frame&#39;:    1011 obs. of  12 variables:

<p>Notice variables X and Y contain the longitude and latitude coordinates of the seats.</p>
<p>Before we plot the seats onto a map, lets look at a basic leaflet.</p>
</div>
<div id="plotting-a-leaflet-map" class="section level2">
<h2>Plotting a Leaflet Map</h2>
<p>Zoom in and explore the map - can you find your house?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>leaflet() %&gt;%
  addTiles</code></pre>
<div id="htmlwidget-1" style="width:672px;height:480px;" class="leaflet html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-1">{"x":{"options":{"crs":{"crsClass":"L.CRS.EPSG3857","code":null,"proj4def":null,"projectedBounds":null,"options":{}}},"calls":[{"method":"addTiles","args":["//{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",null,null,{"minZoom":0,"maxZoom":18,"tileSize":256,"subdomains":"abc","errorTileUrl":"","tms":false,"noWrap":false,"zoomOffset":0,"zoomReverse":false,"opacity":1,"zIndex":1,"detectRetina":false,"attribution":"&copy; <a href=\"http://openstreetmap.org\">OpenStreetMap<\/a> contributors, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC-BY-SA<\/a>"}]}]},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>Looks good, but it’s not really focused on Tasmania - when we plot our seats we’ll have to navigate manually in the map in order to find them - not ideal.</p>
<p>Let’s make it so the map looks directly at Launceston, Tasmania from the get-go.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>leaflet() %&gt;%
  addTiles() %&gt;%
  setView(lng = 147.1376, lat = -41.43584, zoom = 12)</code></pre>
<div id="htmlwidget-2" style="width:672px;height:480px;" class="leaflet html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-2">{"x":{"options":{"crs":{"crsClass":"L.CRS.EPSG3857","code":null,"proj4def":null,"projectedBounds":null,"options":{}}},"calls":[{"method":"addTiles","args":["//{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",null,null,{"minZoom":0,"maxZoom":18,"tileSize":256,"subdomains":"abc","errorTileUrl":"","tms":false,"noWrap":false,"zoomOffset":0,"zoomReverse":false,"opacity":1,"zIndex":1,"detectRetina":false,"attribution":"&copy; <a href=\"http://openstreetmap.org\">OpenStreetMap<\/a> contributors, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC-BY-SA<\/a>"}]}],"setView":[[-41.43584,147.1376],12,[]]},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>Cool, now we can restrict the movement of the map so that it doesn’t let you stray too far by accident.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>leaflet(options = leafletOptions(
  minZoom = 5, dragging = TRUE)) %&gt;%
  addTiles() %&gt;%
  setView(lng = median(seats_data$X), lat = median(seats_data$Y),
            zoom = 13) %&gt;%
  setMaxBounds(lng = min(seats_data$X) - .05, lat = min(seats_data$Y) - 0.5,
               lng2 = max(seats_data$X) + .05, lat2 = max(seats_data$Y) + .05)</code></pre>
<div id="htmlwidget-3" style="width:672px;height:480px;" class="leaflet html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-3">{"x":{"options":{"minZoom":5,"crs":{"crsClass":"L.CRS.EPSG3857","code":null,"proj4def":null,"projectedBounds":null,"options":{}},"dragging":true},"calls":[{"method":"addTiles","args":["//{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",null,null,{"minZoom":0,"maxZoom":18,"tileSize":256,"subdomains":"abc","errorTileUrl":"","tms":false,"noWrap":false,"zoomOffset":0,"zoomReverse":false,"opacity":1,"zIndex":1,"detectRetina":false,"attribution":"&copy; <a href=\"http://openstreetmap.org\">OpenStreetMap<\/a> contributors, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC-BY-SA<\/a>"}]},{"method":"setMaxBounds","args":[-41.9867231083014,146.950173620745,-41.1273923131718,147.416634843179]}],"setView":[[-41.4362542436271,147.140124738666],13,[]]},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>In the map above, try to zoom out and move away from Tasmania - the map pulls back.</p>
<p>Now let’s add markers for each seat in the dataset, pay close attention to the line that starts with ‘addMarkers’:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>leaflet(options = leafletOptions(
  minZoom = 5, dragging = TRUE)) %&gt;%
  addTiles() %&gt;%
  addMarkers(lng = unique(seats_data$X), lat = unique(seats_data$Y)) %&gt;%
  setView(lng = median(seats_data$X), lat = median(seats_data$Y),
          zoom = 13) %&gt;%
  setMaxBounds(lng = min(seats_data$X) - .05, lat = min(seats_data$Y) - 0.5,
               lng2 = max(seats_data$X) + .05, lat2 = max(seats_data$Y) + .05)</code></pre>
<div id="htmlwidget-4" style="width:672px;height:480px;" class="leaflet html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-4">{"x":{"options":{"minZoom":5,"crs":{"crsClass":"L.CRS.EPSG3857","code":null,"proj4def":null,"projectedBounds":null,"options":{}},"dragging":true},"calls":[{"method":"addTiles","args":["//{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",null,null,{"minZoom":0,"maxZoom":18,"tileSize":256,"subdomains":"abc","errorTileUrl":"","tms":false,"noWrap":false,"zoomOffset":0,"zoomReverse":false,"opacity":1,"zIndex":1,"detectRetina":false,"attribution":"&copy;
